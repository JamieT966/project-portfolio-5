[View the live project here](https://chem-eshop.herokuapp.com/)

At the beginning of the pandemic, as sellers of PPE, Chemstore Group set up an online ecommerce store on the Shopify platform. While the Shopify platform is great it has its limitations and costs.

My project features a full ecommerce store that allows users to view chemical safety products. Users are able to fiter them by category, sort by price, name, category, and then add to their bag and checkout securely.

Users can also leave reviews on products, sign up to our newsletter and contact us regarding a product.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### - Header

The header features the Chemstore logo, navigation for products in the centre and three icons to the right, a search icon, an account icon and a bag icon.

![Header](documentation/images/header.png)


#### - Search Icon and Overlay

The search icon when clicked brings up a search input below, this can be used to search the site for all products. An autofocus was added so when the search icon is clicked the user's type is on the search input.

![Search Icon and Overlay](documentation/images/search-overlay.png)


#### Account Dropdown

When clicked the account icon will display a dropdown list. Depending on the logged in status of the site user you will see different links. When the user is logged out they will see 'Register', 'Login' and 'Contact'. If the user is logged in they will see 'My Profile', 'Logout' and 'Contact'. Finally, if an admin user is logged in they will see 'Product Managment', 'My Profile', 'Logout' and 'Contact'.

![Account Dropdown](documentation/images/account-dropdown.png)


#### Bag Notification

If the user currently has nothing in their bag they will just see a bag icon. If the user adds a product or products to their bag a green circle/ bubble will appear with the number of items in their bag.

![Bag Notification](documentation/images/header-bag.png)


#### Hero Section

The hero section is quite simple featuring an illustration of an ecommerce style image to the right and an a site intro on the left. The hero section also features a button to 'Shop Now' that takes the user to the all products page.

There is also a link to the privacy policy at the bottom.

![Footer](documentation/images/footer.png)


#### All Products Page

The all products page displays every product on the store as cards in rows of max 3. This page has a sort by field that allows a user to sort by price, name, rating and category. The produuct cards display the product image, title, price, rating and category below it.

The rating shown is an average of all user ratings for that product.

If the user is an admin they will see two icon buttons to edit and delete a product.

![All Products Page](documentation/images/product-page.png)


#### Edit Product

This feature is only available to admin users, when the edit button is clicked whether from the products page or product detail page it will take you to the edit product page.

An alert displays to notify the admin that they are currently editing a product. The edit product page features a rich text editor thanks to django-ckeditor.

![Edit Product](documentation/images/edit-product.png)


#### Delete Product

When the delete button is clicked the admin user will have a modal appear to confirm if the admin wants to delete the product.

The rating shown is an average of all user ratings for that product.

If the user is an admin they will again see two icon buttons to edit and delete a product.

![Product Detail Page](documentation/images/product-page.png)

User Added to Bag:

![User Added to Bag](documentation/images/add-to-bag.png)

If the product has sizes a sizes option will also appear on the product detail page.

![Product Sizes](documentation/images/product-with-sizes.png)


#### Product Reviews

Below the product container on the product detail page is the reviews section. When a user is signed in a product review form will show on the left side. The user reviews are then displayed on the right. These reviews have the review title, body, the user it was left by and the rating they gave.

Only the user that made the review or an admin has the ability to edit or delete it.

![Product Reviews](documentation/images/product-reviews.png)


#### Edit Review Page

When the user clicks the edit button they are taken to a page with the edit form prefilled with their previous details. At the bottom there is two buttons. The first is to 'Delete Review', this will again take the user to a modal again to confirm delete. Then there is an 'Update Review' button that updates the review.

![Edit Review Page](documentation/images/edit-review.png)

The newsletter sign up page features a simple input field for users to type their email address and be signed up. When submitted the user will get an alert saying that they are now signed up and receive a confirmation email.

![Newsletter Page](documentation/images/newsletter.png)


#### Unsubscribe Page

Near identical to the sign up page, the unsubscribe page has a single input field to delete their email address from our database. When submitted the user will get an alert saying that they are now unsubsribed and receive a confirmation email.

![Newsletter Admin Page](documentation/images/newsletter-admin.png)


#### Custom 404 Page

Finally, I have set up a custom 404 error page (as well as 403, 405 and 500). This presents the user with a relevant image and a link to take them back to the homepage.

![Custom 404 Page](documentation/images/404.png)


### Features which could be implemented in the future

Below are some of the features that I will be working on over the next few weeks.

- __Draft Orders__

Due to the nature of what Chemstore sell many of their customers do not know exactly what product they need. Often times customers contact them about this. On Shopify the sales person can make create a draft order that is then sent to the customer directly to pay.

- __Order Collection__

A few Chemstore customers would prefer to collect their products from the Chemstore factory, this a feature Chemstore can offer on Shopify that I would like to implement in the future.

- __Stock/ Inventory Management__

Another feature that I would like to implement in the future is an option to import an inventory file for product management.

- __Product Gallery__

Next I would like to have a product gallery on the product detail page. 

- __Shipping Costs__

With the products that Chemstore offer varying so much in size and weight I would like to have a feature that an admin can set a product's shipping cost.

- __Featured Product__

Another feature I will be implementing will be the ability to have a featured product in any given category like in my wirefreames.

## Testing

### Validator Testing 

[W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) found a few issues that I am going to classify as bugs.

1. Products page found an error Duplicate ID exampleModalLabel. 
- This is due to me having a modal to confirm that the user wants to delete a product or review. The modal has to be in my for loop for it to work.

2. Edit product page found multiple errors.
- These errors are being caused by a django installation, ckeditor and not due to my code.

3. Product detail page found multiple errors.
- These are again being caused by django-ckeditor.

__Pages Checked__

- Home Page
- Products Page
- Product Detail Page
- Add Product Page
- Edit Product Page
- Edit Review Page
- Profile Page
- Sign Up Page
- Unsubscribe Page
- Contact Page
- Bag Page
- Checkout Page
- Checkout Success Page
- Sign Up Page
- Login Page
- Logout Page
- 404 Page

[W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) found no issues.

All code has been beautified with [Beautifier.io](https://beautifier.io/)

All code has been made PEP8 compliant.

### Manual Testing Test Cases and Results 

### Known bugs

I had a an issue with my webhooks not working and confirmation emails subsequently not being sent. To fix this issue I had to copy over the entirety of Boutique Ado's checkout code. I then could not migrate these model changes to Heroku. This was eventually fixed but I thought that I should make note of it just in case.
