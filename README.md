<h1 align="center">Chem-eShop</h1>

[View the live project here](https://chem-eshop.herokuapp.com/)

At the beginning of the pandemic, as sellers of PPE, Chemstore Group set up an online ecommerce store on the Shopify platform. While the Shopify platform is great it has its limitations and costs.

My project features a full ecommerce store that allows users to view chemical safety products. Users are able to fiter them by category, sort by price, name, category, and then add to their bag and checkout securely.

Users can also leave reviews on products, sign up to our newsletter and contact us regarding a product.
